Machine Learning Regression Model to Predict Apartment Prices in Tehran (Toman)

This project uses a real-world dataset of nearly 4,000 apartment listings in Tehran to build a machine learning model that predicts property prices in Toman based on key features like area (sqm), number of rooms, parking availability, storage, elevator, and approximate location within Tehran.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and deployment through a simple and intuitive Streamlit web application.
